# SARS-CoV-2-Deletions
This repository includes codes we used to study deletions (indels) in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. It should be noted that due to GISAID privacy and policy, some input data used for our calculations are not publicly available.

We show that in-frame deletions (IFDs) play a significant and rapidly increasing role in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The percentage of genomes and lineages with IFDs is increasing rapidly, especially in the emerging variants of concern (VOCs). Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution uncovers co-occurrence (i.e., highly correlated presence) of IFDs, especially IFDs on spike N-terminal domain and non-structural protein 6 (NSP6) is a shared feature in several VOCs such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron. IFDs are highly recurrent (appear independently multiple times) in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and appear to affect interactions with the host immune components. IFDs distribution is correlated with spike mutations associated with immune escape and growth in the number of genomes with IFDs coincides with the increasing population resistance due to vaccination and previous infections. The IFDs occur in the spike glycoprotein, but also in other proteins, especially those involved in interactions with the host immune system. We also showed that IFDs concentrated on specific regions of individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins known as recurrent-deletion regions (RDRs) which are mostly located in protein loop regions. Structural analysis suggests that IFDs remodel viral proteins’ surfaces at common epitopes and interaction interfaces, affecting the virus’ interactions with host proteins. We hypothesize that the increased frequency of IFDs, the non-random distribution of IFDs and their independent co-occurrence in several VOCs from diverse geographic origins (i.e., repeated appearance of the same combinations of IFDs) is an adaptive response to elevated global population immunity.
