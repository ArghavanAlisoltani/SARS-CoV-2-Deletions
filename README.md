# SARS-CoV-2-Indels
This repository includes codes we used to study indels in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes as published in the below paper.

We show that, as the pandemic extends into its second year, the numbers and ratio of genomes with in-frame insertions and deletions (indels) increase significantly, especially among the variants of concern (VOCs). Monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution shows that co-occurrence (i.e., highly correlated presence) of indels, especially deletions on spike N-terminal domain and non-structural protein 6 (NSP6) is a shared feature in several VOCs such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Indels distribution is correlated with spike mutations associated with immune escape and growth in the number of genomes with indels coincides with the increasing population resistance due to vaccination and previous infections. Indels occur most frequently in the spike, but also in other proteins, especially those involved in interactions with the host immune system. We also showed that indels concentrate in regions of individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins known as hypervariable regions (HVRs) that are mostly located in specific loop regions. Structural analysis suggests that indels remodel viral proteins’ surfaces at common epitopes and interaction interfaces, affecting the virus’ interactions with host proteins. We hypothesize that the increased frequency of indels, the non-random distribution of them, and their independent co-occurrence in several VOCs is another mechanism of response to elevated global population immunity.
